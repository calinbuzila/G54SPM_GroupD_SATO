# G54SPM_GroupD_SATO

The Project:

SATO is a game that is aimed at treating amblyopia, while remaining far more enjoyable than other treatments, 
such as patching.  It will play much in a similar way to Galaga, and many other retro-shooters.  It will
be displayed on a VR headset; however not all of the same information will be displayed across both screens.
To succeed at SATO, information that is mutually exclusive to each screen has to be combined, thus forcing
both eyes to focus at all times and cooperate.
